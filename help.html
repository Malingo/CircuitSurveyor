			How to use CircuitSurveyor:
		</h1>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<img src="media/screenshot-a.png" width="100%">
			</p>
			<p>
				Select a circuit file from the drop-down menu (<b class="letter">A</b>). (Use
				the <b>Add new...</b> button (<b class="letter">B</b>) to choose files from the
				local file system to add to the drop-down list. See <a href="custom.html">this
				page</a> for instructions on creating custom circuit files.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The program will draw the selected circuit. The <b>Circuit</b> and <b>Circuit
				labels</b> checkboxes (<b class="letter">C</b> and <b class="letter">D</b>) toggle
				whether or not the circuit diagram and the labels specifying the battery potentials
				and resistances of the circuit elements are displayed.
			</p>
			<p>
				After selecting the desired circuit, press the <b>Okay</b> button (<b
				class="letter">E</b>) to load it. Only at this point does the program calculate the
				fields.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <b>Gradient</b> checkbox (<b class="letter">F</b>) toggles the display of the
				circuit's potential gradient; the location in the circuit with the highest potential
				will be colored black, and the lowest potential will be white.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <b>Slope field</b> checkbox (<b class="letter">G</b>) toggles the display of the
				circuit's Poynting vector slope field; at each gridpoint within the circuit, a unit
				arrow is drawn in the the direction ofthe Poynting vector (energy flow).
			</p>
			<p>
				The <b>Flow lines</b> checkbox (<b class="letter">H</b>) toggles the display of the
				circuit's Poynting vector flow lines; lines are drawn tracing the energy flow
				through the circuit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving the mouse around over a loaded circuit has several effects. First, the
				numerical components of the electric field vector, magnetic field vector, and
				Poynting vector at the location of the pointer are displayed
				in the bottom left corner of the window (<b class="letter">I</b>).
				Second, the electric field vector, magnetic field vector, and Poynting vector at
				that location are displayed on the screen, in blue, green, and yellow, respectively
				(<b class="letter">J</b>).
			</p>
			<p>
				If the mouse is clicked while positioned over the circuit, the displayed vector
				arrows are fixed onto the screen. This can be done repeatedly at any location within
				the circuit. The <b>Clear arrows</b> button (<b class="letter">K</b>) erases any
				vector arrows that have been fixed in this way.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <b>Help</b> button (<b class="letter">L</b>) opens this page in the user's default
				web browser.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Technical note:
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					CircuitSurveyor models a circuit as a two-dimensional slice through a stack of 
					identical circuits extending infinitely into and out of the screen, comprising
					infinitely long solenoids. (Only using this model is the analysis tractable and
					the visualization effective.) Therefore, there is no magnetic field (and thus no
					Poynting vector) on the exterior of the circuit.
				</p>
